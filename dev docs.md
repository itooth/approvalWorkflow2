# BeeFlow Node.js Backend Development Plan

## Project Background & Goals

### Background
BeeFlow is an open-source workflow automation system with an existing Vue.js frontend. The frontend provides:
- Visual workflow designer
- Form designer
- Approval process management
- Organization structure management

The original implementation uses Java + Activiti 7 for the backend. This project aims to create a more lightweight and developer-friendly alternative using Node.js.

### Goals
1. **Simplification**: Create a more approachable backend implementation compared to the Java version
2. **Modern Stack**: Utilize modern Node.js practices and TypeScript for better developer experience
3. **API Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with the existing Vue.js frontend
4. **Flexibility**: Support both simple and complex workflow scenarios
5. **Performance**: Ensure efficient handling of workflow processes
6. **Extensibility**: Make it easy to add new workflow node types and business rules
